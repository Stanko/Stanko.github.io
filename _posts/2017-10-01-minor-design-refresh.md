I kinda got bored by the current design.
Rotating SVGs in the header ate too much CPU power (oh [the irony](/what-is-the-point/)).
So I decided to change a thing or two.

First thing was to get rid of the rotation.
Then logo got replaced and I added this [marvelous font](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin).
Header is a bit smaller now and footer blends more with the page.
Typography did undergo some small changes, and both buttons and borders are not lighter as well.
Code snippets are now using a light theme, which should be easier on the eye.

This is just a minor refresh until I do a full redesign (one of the [trillion ideas](/trillion-ideas/)).
