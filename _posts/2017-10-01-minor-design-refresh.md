title: Minor design refresh
category: [Random]

I kinda got bored by the current design.
Rotating SVGs in the header ate too much CPU power (oh [the irony](/what-is-the-point/)).
So I decided to change a thing or two.

First thing was to get rid of the rotation.
Then logo got replaced and I added this [marvelous font](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin#get-the-font).
Header is a bit smaller now and footer blends more with the page.
Code snippets are now using a light theme, which should be easier on the eye.

This is just a minor refresh until I do a full redesign (one of the [trillion ideas](/trillion-ideas/)).
