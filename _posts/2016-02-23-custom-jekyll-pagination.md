Jekyl comes with simple pagination which has only `Newer` and `Older` links.
I wanted a little bit more, now pagination shows at least five pages, with current in the middle.
On the larger screens there are also first and last page links.
`Newer` and `Older` links are, of course, still there.

Check the [gist with the code](https://gist.github.com/Stanko/4e379a72715fc596c1cc).

You can see it on the website, but you can check the screenshot too:
