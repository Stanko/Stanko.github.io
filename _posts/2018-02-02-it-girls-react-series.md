This time we joined forces with our friends from [IT Girls](http://itgirls.rs/).
They are promoting tech among women, and helping them start a career in it.
Together, we are organizing a series of meetups and workshops about React.

Last night, my colleague Nemanja and myself had a pleasure to give the first talk in the series.
We are planning to have one more meetup followed by a couple of workshops,
and for a great finale, hackathon will be organized.

After yesterday's introduction to React, we'll continue with more in depth talks,
including more code examples. To reserve your place, make sure you apply in time,
by following [IT Girls'](http://itgirls.rs/) website and Facebook.

Due to large interest, we might repeat the first talk.
Slides are available for [download](/public/pdf/Introduction to React.pdf).
