I want to brag a little - my npm packages have been downloaded more than
<label class="SideNote-trigger">1 million times</label>
<small class="SideNote">
Stats are coming from [npm-stat.com](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?author=stanko&from=2018-01-01&to=2018-12-31).

And I finally got a real domain:

I've been quiet for the last couple of months. Mostly because I was busy with other things, both work and personal. But I do have a few small side projects I will be sharing soon.

Stay tuned!
