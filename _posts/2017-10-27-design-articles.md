Just wanted to share two articles that helped me understand visual design better.
I was already aware of the most of these things, but having someone explain it how and why was really helpful.

* [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda)
* [Optical Effects in User Interfaces (for True Nerds)](https://medium.muz.li/optical-effects-9fca82b4cd9a)

### Learn more about design

When asked how to learn more about design as a developer,
design partner in my company recommended studying work of these two designers.
I haven't taken my time to do it, but it is on my todo list.

* [Massimo Vignelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Vignelli) - author of NYC subway map
* [Paul Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) - author of the IBM logo

Frontend developers should have at least basic understanding of visual design.
Because great products are symbiosis of both great design and great tech.
Hopefully, these links will help you in that regard.
