I needed simple React slider component, as we are building our new website as a universal React application.
But I did not find anything lightweight. There is a crazy trend in JavaScript world - add gazillion dependencies.

So again, I made something myself.

</a>

Check the [demo](http://stanko.github.io/react-slider/).


It has <b>no dependencies</b>, and about 200 lines of code.
Very simple and extensible. Every modern browser is supported and IE10+.

IE9 should work (if you adapt the CSS), but I didn't test it.

Grab the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stanko/react-slider).
