Two days ago, we held the second Tech Meetup.
There were two speakers including myself, and Nemanja Nićiforović, our CEO.
Nemanja spoke <i>How to Freelance</i>, and I covered <i>Intro to React</i>.

We are very thankful to our friends at
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zaokret/">Zaokret</a> where meetup took place.
There were around 60 people and we hope even more people will come to the next one.
Hopefully, we are not going to make a year long pause like we did between this and the last one.
