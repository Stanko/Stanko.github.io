I'm happy to announce [Marvin](https://github.com/workco/marvin), boilerplate for kicking off React/Redux applications.

[![Marvin on Github](/public/img/marvin.jpg)](https://github.com/workco/marvin)

Basically my [boilerplate](/webpack-2-react-redux/) became Work & Co's internal project. It is meant to be a starting point for our React projects. This way faster development is assured along with higher quality code. It is open source, and external contributions are welcome.

Name comes from a fictional character Marvin, android from the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book as a homage to it's author Douglas Adams.
