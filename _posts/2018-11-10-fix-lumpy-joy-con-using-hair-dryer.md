I love my

I have a huge draft about Switch, and how it have put the fun back in gaming for me. It takes me forever to publish it.

Unfortunately, tonight I noticed that one of my Joy-Cons has weird lumps on it.

On multiple forum threads, people suggested using hair dryer to fix it. But nobody did explain how. I tried it, and in couple of minutes I managed to get it, and here is how I did it.

There are tiny inserts in the cap, and they need to go in to the tiny holes on the joystick. I had three of them fall out. To fix it, just heat it with the hair dryer (I did it for about ten seconds), carefully adjust one insert and rub it a little bit until it falls in. Repeat for each insert.

It was much easier than I thought it would be (before heating it felt impossible). Hopefully they won't fall again, but I will probably get thumb grips to be sure.
