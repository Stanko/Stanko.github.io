Friends of mine from the band [Time Pills](https://soundcloud.com/timepills) opensourced bunch of their tracks. You can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/nndmlsvc/time-pills). They are looking forward to having them remixed by creative people and sharing it with the world

Repo contains all of the tracks, stems, presets, loops and even midi files.

Enjoy!
