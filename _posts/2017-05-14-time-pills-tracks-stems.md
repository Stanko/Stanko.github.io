Friends of mine from the band [Time Pills](https://soundcloud.com/timepills) opensourced bunch of their tracks. You can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/nndmlsvc/time-pills). They are looking forward to creative people remixing their them and sharing it with the world. So go nuts!

Repo contains all of the tracks, stems, presets, loops and even midi files.
