I started leading teams relatively early in my career.
Mentoring and leading younger developers is something I tremendously enjoy.
But there is one thing I really miss about being a "regular" developer.

And that is - being able to put my headphones, play some rock 'n' roll,
and code for a couple of hours without any distractions.

Something that is almost impossible today. I'm not complaining,
but the truth is that I really miss it.
Luckily, I can fulfill my geek needs working on pet projects.

Cheers!
