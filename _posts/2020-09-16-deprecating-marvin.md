It is funny, I would never say I would be sad to deprecate a software project. Especially a project boilerplate. But I just merged the deprecation notice, and I do feel down a little.

I created [Marvin](https://github.com/workco/marvin) about [four years ago](/webpack-2-react-redux/) for my own needs. Since then it grew, became internal project at

Fun fact, [our website](https://work.co) is made on top of Marvin.

and was used by thousands of people.

## Why?

When Marvin was created React landscape was looking a lot different than today. The ecosystem continues to relentlessly evolve and maintaining a single boilerplate to capture all these possibilities has become unproductive.

The repo will stay available, but we are stopping further improvements and maintenance.


## Thank you!

A [big thank you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish) to everyone who used and supported Marvin!
