2020 was a hard one.

I started writing this post in December, but I couldn't make myself finish it. The whole situation with COVID made me anxious at times and I didn't really have motivation for my side projects including this blog. But I won't focus on bad things, everyone had a tough year, so let's try to stay positive.

## Generative Art

I had one huge positive this year - I got into [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art). My fiance likes to say that I woke up on the first on January and <i>started drawing some triangles</i>. [Triangles](https://codepen.io/stanko/pen/XWJeBqQ) were super naive, but I'm super happy with my progress and these are some of my creations (all pen plotted):

Special thanks to Vladimir MitroviÄ‡ who was the only person I knew doing generative art. When I reached out, he selflessly helped me start with the whole thing. Be sure to visit [his website](https://brutalism.rs/) as he is doing amazing stuff.

I [already wrote](/archive/#/generative-art) about my generative work a little, but I will create a separate site section for my artwork. Meanwhile, you can see the most of my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/muffinman_io/). I'm super thrilled that people like my art enough to hang it on their walls.

All of my work is done with pen plotting in mind. I'm using [AxiDraw SE/A3](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/908) by Evil Mad Scientist and I love everything about this machine. Pen plotting is something that I want to write more about in the future.

## Blog

This year I neglected the blog a little. Mostly because I was focused on generative stuff, and I was doing that instead of writing posts. The pandemic didn't help either.

I [removed Google Analytics](/blog/this-blog-is-now-google-free/) in favor of [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), a simple open source web analytics which are not tracking my readers.

Even without writing much, I had more visits than in 2020. But you can see the drop in May, about the same time I removed Google Analytics. Coincidence or not, I can't say. The second drop happened in early December, as I moved posts under `/blog` prefix but screwed up the redirections. I can only hope search engines won't derank me too much because of that.

People are still not sticking around after reading one article, but that is ok, I never optimized for that. I'm happy to see that traffic is still mainly organic, coming from the search engines. Interesting thing is that macOS is almost tied with Windows.

## Work

### Working from home

I'm fortunate enough to have a dedicate work space. A small study with a <label class="SideNote-trigger">good chair</label>
<small class="SideNote">
I'm a big fan of Steelcase chairs
</small> and a monitor. Pretty much the same setup as the one I have at work. All in all, I think I was more productive working from home, mainly due to the lack of distractions. But man, I miss working from office, along with all of it's distractions.

### Our website

I'm proud to say I was part of the team who developed a new version of [Work & Co website](https://work.co/). I love it's design and the grid navigation. Fully made in React.

### IKEA

For about year and a half I was working with some great people in IKEA on their new web experience and the new design system. It was a super pleasant and insightful experience.


## Side projects

If I remember correctly, I haven't released any npm libraries this year. Like I said, I was spending my time drawing with code. However, number of downloads is still on the upward trend. It reached whopping 9 millions this year!

Some of my generative work is open source and interactive. For all other drawings, please check my generative work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/muffinman_io/), until I build a real artwork section.

Interactive ones you can find here:

* [Neon](https://neon.muffinman.io/)
* [Breathe](https://breathe.muffinman.io/)
* [Swirls](https://muffinman.io/generative-swirls/)

## Thank you!

Post is a little bit chaotic, which fits the theme of 2020. I just wanted to get it out there as it took me so long to finish it. Thank you for reading my ramblings and <label class="SideNote-trigger">let's hope 2021 will be a better year.</label>
<small class="SideNote">
It has to be, right?!

Take care!
