Muffin Man is back! This time with new visual identity.

This was long overdue, but new design took me
<label class="SideNote-trigger">more than I wanted to.</label>
<small class="SideNote">Mostly because of the [trillion](/trillion-ideas/) things I'm working on.</small>
Now I can get back to writing.

Alogn with the new design, some other things got updated too,
hopefully making content easier to browse. To name a few:

* Archive is now one page with categories accordion (every category used to have a dedicated page)
* You can now find related posts under each post (instead of the latest ones)
* Search results are now navigable using arrows


I ditched custom Jekyll plugins to be able to use GitHub to automatically build the whole thing.
Some of them got rewritten to Liquid.

Hope you like it!
