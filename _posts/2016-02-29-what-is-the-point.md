title: What is the point of the website if it kills my laptop?
category: [web, rants]

People need to realize that is not enough to have a nice website with a tone of animations and effects.
There is no point having such website if I can't scroll it, while CPU and coolers go crazy.
And I use latest MacBook with max hardware. Can't image trying to use those website on the old machine (or IE8-9).

Get your performance together.
