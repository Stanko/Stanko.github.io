### Wat <br><small>Gary Bernhardt, 2012</small>

The talk I shared too many times. Gary talks about weird stuff in Ruby and JavaScript.
It is witty and educational at the same time. I guarantee it will make you laugh.
Only four minutes long, give it a try.

### Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel <br><small>Dan Abramov, 2015</small>

We all know Dan Abramov and what he has done for the React/JS community.
This is his talk before he became famous and started working for Facebook.
It is about hot reloading in React, which he made mainstream.

It is best described with a YouTube comment: "All that was missing was the mic drop at the end.ï»¿"

### The Early Days of id Software<br><small>John Romero, 2016</small>

Wow! This reminded me why I started programming, and how I ended up where I am today.
I started with the only one thing in mind - to write games.

Historical talk about couple of kids who wanted to do exactly that.
How they started, what they principles were. For those who don't know id Software is behind
Doom, Quake, Commander Keen, Wolfenstein, and many more games.
Don't get scared because it is almost one hour long, talk itself if about thirty minutes.

It got me thinking about writing games again,
and hopefully I will have a blog post about that soon.

### Adjusting the Dials in the Circuits of the Human Brain with Deep by Brain Stimulation<br> <small>Dr Andres Lozan, 2016</small>

I watched this one live and the ng-conf 2016, and it blew me away.
It has nothing to do with a development, but medicine.
How doctors are able to adjust brain functions by applying electricity to a certain parts.

It still sounds like a science fiction to me.
