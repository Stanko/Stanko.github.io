title: I washed my headphones
category: [Random]
---

Recently I lost my iPhone headphones.
I didn't care much, as they were almost 3 years old, and I had a brand new ones.
But today, while getting ready for work, I found them in the pocket
of the pants I washed about week ago.

I was sure they wouldn't work, but guess what? They do!
Probably the fact that they dried for days helped.

So I guees I have a spare pair of headphones now :)
