message = "Hello,\n\nThanks for this great article, just had some questions since I'm having difficulty running your code. See I've upgraded to webpack 2.x and did the necessary changes to make it run and most of it works well but I'm stuck at this error.\n\n[error]\nERROR in chunk html [entry]\napp.js\nConflict: Multiple assets emit to the same filename app.js\n [/error]\n\nI'm not sure what could be the problem causing it :/ Anyway it was a awesome read especially for me since I've just started on the whole webpack babel react thing.\n\nDo you think you can update your code to run on webpack 2.x.x or thats too much to ask ?\n\nAnyway thanks again."
