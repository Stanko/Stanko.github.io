message = "Hey Pedro,\n\nThanks for the feedback, it is really hard to get this thing up to date. I will try my best, and definitely have that in mind for the new posts. And you are right, I forgot to add <code>react-router</code> to the <code>package.json</code>. It is now updated, and I added a simple routing example (the one from this post) as well.\n\n\nHey Dev,\n\nThanks, unfortunately I don't plansto update this guide to Webpack 2, but I have a complete boilerplate for it. Check <a href=\"/webpack-2-react-redux/\">this post</a>, it has much more options.\n\nAs for your error take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/issues/294\">this thread</a>. It seems to be a issue with <code> CommonsChunkPlugin</code>.\n\nCheers both of you!"
