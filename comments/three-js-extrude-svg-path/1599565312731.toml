message = "\"If you can explain this and how to get their actual position in the scene, please leave a comment.\"\n\ni can actually explain this, yay.\n\nthe different shapes have an offset from 0 when they are drawn. so let's say the first M has it's bottom left corner at your 0,0 point, the NEXT M has IT'S bottom left corner at the end of the FIRST M's bottom right corner. see it has an offset in its drawing from 0,0, this is why each SHAPE has a position of 0,0,0 if you move,say the second M, you will see it position is offset from where you moved it to by the width of the first M.\n\nto fix this, change this code:\n<pre>const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);</pre>\nto\n<pre>geometry.center();\n\nconst mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material); </pre>\nand then you can remove this:\n<pre>svgGroup.children.forEach(item => {\n  item.position.x = xOffset;\n  item.position.y = yOffset;\n});</pre>"
