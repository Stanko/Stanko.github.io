message = "Hey Joseph,\n\nMaking a single page application SEO friendly is not an easy task. \n\nThe best solution is server side rendering (which I also plan to cover later on). It means having the same React application execute on a server (in node environment) when web request comes to it. Then it returns rendered HTML to a client (and search engine crawlers).\n\nOnce loaded on the client side, same React app loads in the browser and takes over. So the first render happens on the server and then it continues to work as a regular single page app.\n\nOther, simpler, but uglier solution is to make a simple crawler which will go through your app and cache all of the responses. Then it would recognize search engine robots and serve them these static pages rather then your app.\n\nMy advice would be to go with server side rendering, it is harder, but it is cleaner solution. And you don't have to worry about invalidating the static pages cache.\n\nThanks!"
