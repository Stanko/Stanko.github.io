message = "Great tutorial @Stanko. Thanks for your work!\n\nTo make it a bit more Windows users friendly I suggest to replace this command:\n./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js ./src/js/app.js --output-filename ./dist/app.bundle.js\n\nwith this:\n./node_modules/.bin/webpack ./src/js/app.js --output-filename ./dist/app.bundle.js\n\nBecause in Windows' terminal the first command instead of launching webpack will open webpack.js file in user's default app for *.js files. Looks like it happens because Windows is not familiar with \"shebang\" sequence.\nThe second variant will work on Windows fine and I'm pretty sure that it should work well on Mac OS and Linux."
