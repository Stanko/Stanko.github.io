message = "Yo!\n\nI was having trouble with postcss and it was causing compilation errors (11/12/2017): after some stackoverflowing I was able to find a fix that worked for me:\n\nrequiring webpack at the top of my `webpack.config.js`\n\n<pre>const webpack = require('webpack');</pre>\n\nand then inside of the `plugins: []` block, I put a new `webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin`:\n\nEx:\n\n<pre>plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    template: path.join(paths.SRC, 'index.html'),\n  }),\n  new ExtractTextPlugin('style.bundle.css'),\n  new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({\n      options: {\n        context: __dirname,\n      postcss: [\n          autoprefixer, precss\n      ]\n    }\n  })\n],</pre>"
