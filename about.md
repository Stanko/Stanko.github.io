Hello there.

My name is Stanko and I'm technology director at [Work & Co](https://work.co). My focus are large scale front end applications, their scalability and maintainability.

I tremendously enjoy software development, experimenting with small projects and playing with random technologies. That is where this blog comes from.

I fool around on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/stanko/) and maintain a few [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~stanko) packages. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stanko) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stankotadic).

My other interests are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/muffinman_io/">generative art</a>, music,

Among other things I made my own electric guitar.

and gaming. Old DOS games are what got me into the tech in the first place. I love indie games and I'm so happy that we have indie game revolution going on. I'm also a terrible guitar player.

Nick Muffin Man comes from the [Frank Zappa's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMwY49vTBk0) of the same name.
