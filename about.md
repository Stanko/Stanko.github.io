Hello there.

My name is Stanko and I'm technology director at [Work & Co](https://work.co).
My focus is on the front end architecture and modern frameworks like Angular and React.

This blog comes from the fact that I tremendously enjoy software development,
experimenting on small projects
and playing with random technologies.

I fool around on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/stanko/) and maintain a few [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~stanko) packages.
You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stanko) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stankotadic).

Beside programming, my passions are music, crafts (making everything from jewelry to guitars) and gaming.
Old DOS games are what got me in the tech in the first place.
Unfortunately due to lack of free time I don't play many games these days.
I'm also a terrible guitar player.

As few people asked, nick Muffin Man comes from the [Frank Zappa's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMwY49vTBk0) of the same name.
