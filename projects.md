These are selected open source projects I did. Most of these are JavaScript or CSS libraries.
Beside that, I contribute to a few bigger open source projects, and fool around on
[CodePen](http://codepen.io/stanko/).

Few of these need some love, as maintaining a lot of small projects takes quite a bit of time.
So feel free to open a pull request :)
