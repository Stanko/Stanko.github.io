Create React App became defacto starting point when building React apps. It is great, but from my experience a lot people are overseeing what it can do. Please check the readme, it has a bunch of nifty features.
Some features I think often get overlooked:

* TypeScript support
* Importing SVG files as components
* Using snapshoting tools
