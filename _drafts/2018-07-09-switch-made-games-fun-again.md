Couple of months ago I bought Nintendo Switch and I enjoy it tremendously! I never owned a console and thought I never will (who needs it when I already own a computer?). But when Zelda, Breath of the Wild was released, consoles got my attention for the first time.

Zelda looked beautiful, a perfect open world game with bright atmosphere (I never was into games with dark atmosphere, although I did play fair number of those*). But I couldn't justify Switch purchase just to play a single game. And I thought I would get tired of it - I blame modern games and online multiplayer for that. Why you ask?

## How I lost my interested in gaming

I really love games and they are the main reason I [started programming](my-programming-story). To the people who don't understand the joy of it, I explain gaming by comparing it to watching a movie or reading a book, and being the main character in it. Old games, I grew up on, were all about two things - telling a story with brilliant gameplay. It is part my nostalgia, but part is a fact that back then people making games were mostly enthusiasts, who weren't in it for the money.

Somewhere along the line the joy of gaming was mostly lost for me. Small/indie games got overrun with

<small class="SideNote">

games.
Suits took over. Gaming industry revenue surpassed movie industry. Online multiplier instead of single player campaigns. Lack of story. Micro transactions. Obsession with graphics…

Don't get me wrong, there are gems among these, and I understand the underlying business. I'm guilty of spending countless hours playing these games with DotA being one of my favorite ones. But even DotA lost it's magic when I started taking it too serious (it became more of a job than a game). All these things pilled up and killed the joy of gaming for me.

Then came the

revolution (with titles like Cave Story and Braid), and although I was incredibly happy, magic was lost for me. I just couldn't immerse myself and enjoy these games. Most of the people simply explained it by age - you got too old for gaming. Slowly I stopped playing games, even DotA I played so long.


## And how I got it back

Then few months ago a friend of mine borrowed me his Switch for a week. He was kind enough to give it to me for a test run to decide will I buy the thing. It got three games Zelda, Mario Odyssey and Overcooked. The first hour or two blew me away and that was enough to give me justification needed for buying it.

After spending couple of weeks playing it, I happily realized it brought fun back to playing games. There are few factors, but the main one is that most of the Switch games are made to be fun.


### Switch

As I never owned a console, part of my exciment would be shared no matter which console I got. Being able to just pick up the controller and start playing was something I wasn't used to.

On top of that, Switch is so well thought and amazing. User experience is excelent - switching from hand held to tv, splitting joycons to multiple people, pairing them, motion controls… everything works smoothly.
