  Hi! I maintain nvm, and "nvm doesnâ€™t let you update only npm" is utterly
  incorrect. nvm does not have any impact on your ability to update npm, except
  that it removes the need to use `sudo`.


  `npm install -g npm` *always works*, and if it doesn't work for you, please
  file an issue on nvm's repo, because you'll be the first person on the planet
  to report it.
