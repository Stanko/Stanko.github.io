  Hey Jordan, 


  First I want to thank you for working on nvm, it is a life saver! 


  I encountered this issue with updating npm while using nvm in 2017, and `npm i
  -g npm` didn't work for some reason. However, it did work when I had a single
  node version installed from their website. And I remember seeing quite a few
  people with the same problem on stack overflow. 


  That is why I wrongly accused nvm, and I'm sorry for that, but there is no
  reason to be passive agressive. I will update the post to reflect this.


  Cheers!
