  Elvan,


  Can't really tell what is wrong from the stack you pasted. It seems that you
  are probably missing node modules.


  Try running <code>webpack --display-error-details</code>, it may give you more
  details about the error.


  In the end, clone <a href="https://github.com/Stanko/react-tutorial">this
  repository</a>, I created for this tutorial, and compare it to your code.
