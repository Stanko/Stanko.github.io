  @Stuart I'm pretty sure that is happening because you are using webpack 2 or 3,
  and this tutorial was written for webpack one.
  You can install webpack 1, but I wouldn't recommend downgrading.


  I already written
  <a href="https://stanko.github.io/webpack-2-react-redux/">boilerplate for webpack 2</a>
  (which should be soon updated to use webpack 3). So you can use that or
  Facebook's offical
  <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>.


  I won't be updating this tutorial, but I might write another one in the future.


  Cheers!


  @Ram you are welcome mate!
