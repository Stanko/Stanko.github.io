  Thanks for the article.


  However, when I try to run 

  node ./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js

  I get the following error: 

  Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialised using a
  configuration object that does not match the API schema.
   - configuration.resolve.extensions[0] should not be empty.

  not sure how to resolve.
