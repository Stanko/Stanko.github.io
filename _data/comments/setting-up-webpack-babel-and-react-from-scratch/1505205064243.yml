  this part of code will caused an issue when you configure scripts in package.json like


  <pre>
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --hot"
  }.
  </pre>


  When I try to run `npm start` command, Invalid configuration object issue
  returned due to the configuration.resolve.extensions[0] should not be empty.


  So I change the 0 index of extensions to ' ' solve this problem. And also
  thanks for your blog to help me understanding how react, webpack and babel are
  working.
