  Hello,


  Thanks for this great article, just had some questions since I'm having
  difficulty running your code. See I've upgraded to webpack 2.x and did the
  necessary changes to make it run and most of it works well but I'm stuck at
  this error.


  [error]

  ERROR in chunk html [entry]

  app.js

  Conflict: Multiple assets emit to the same filename app.js
   [/error]

  I'm not sure what could be the problem causing it :/ Anyway it was a awesome
  read especially for me since I've just started on the whole webpack babel
  react thing.


  Do you think you can update your code to run on webpack 2.x.x or thats too
  much to ask ?


  Anyway thanks again.
