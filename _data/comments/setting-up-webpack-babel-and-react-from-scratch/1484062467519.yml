  Hey Darrel, thanks for the feedback.


  Yes, <code>.babelrc</code> file goes to the project root folder (I updated the post as
  well).


  Now at the end of the post you can find complete <code>webpack.config.js</code> and
  <code>package.json</code> files. Besides that, I created a repository with working example to go
  along with the tutorial.


  Hope you'll find it useful.
