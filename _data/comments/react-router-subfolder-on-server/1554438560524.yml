  In my case there are two projects in two different subdirectories. and based
  on request i want to redirect to that particular project.


  For e.g. 

  www.test.com/us should go to project residing in 'us' directory

  and

  same should happen with www.test.com/in 



  RewriteRule ^ /path/to/subfolder/index.html [L]

  How can I get subfolder dynamically from url.


  Please help
