  Hello Ram,


  That won't work as <code>location.pathname</code> is dynamic property. For
  example it will be <code>/</code> on your home page, but something like
  <code>/users/view/1</code> on user profile. Then all of your links would be
  relative to <code>/users/view/1</code> instead of <code>/</code>.


  Cheers!
