  Thanks for you comment man! I've been searching around how to work the build
  react app on IIS. Im using connected react router and i set my homepage from
  what you've said there, setting the basename for history


  <pre>history =
  createBrowserHistory({basename: `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}`

  })
  </pre>


  and voila! when the page refreshed, the 404 error page was gone. Thanks again!
