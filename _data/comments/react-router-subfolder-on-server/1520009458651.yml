  Hello @Biswajit,


  Unfortunately, I can't help you with that as I have no experience with IIS,
  but a quick search provided me with <a
  href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/application-frameworks/install-and-configure-php-applications-on-iis/translate-htaccess-content-to-iis-webconfig">Translate
  .htaccess Content to IIS web.config</a>. Hopefully that will help you.


  Cheers!
