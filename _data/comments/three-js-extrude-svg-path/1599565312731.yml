  i can actually explain this, yay.


  the different shapes have an offset from 0 when they are drawn. so let's say
  the first M has it's bottom left corner at your 0,0 point, the NEXT M has IT'S
  bottom left corner at the end of the FIRST M's bottom right corner. see it has
  an offset in its drawing from 0,0, this is why each SHAPE has a position of
  0,0,0 if you move,say the second M, you will see it position is offset from
  where you moved it to by the width of the first M.


  to fix this, change this code:

  ```
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  ```

  to 

  ```
  geometry.center();

  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  ```

  and then you can remove this:

  ```
  svgGroup.children.forEach(item => {
    item.position.x = xOffset;
    item.position.y = yOffset;
  });
  ```
