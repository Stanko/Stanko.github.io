  Hey Lars,

  I downloaded your blog's repo and dug around but I couldn't get Travis working
  :( 


  I'm pretty sure that it doesn't matter if it is a user or organization.


  Personally, I would start setup from scratch following this link:

  If you manage to get everything working, please share your solution.


  Cheers!
