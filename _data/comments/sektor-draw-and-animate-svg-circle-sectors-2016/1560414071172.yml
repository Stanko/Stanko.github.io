  Hey Bean,

  I'm really glad Sektor was useful for you.


  To add easing you need to change this line:

  <a
  href="https://github.com/Stanko/sektor/blob/gh-pages/js/sektor.es6.js#L57">sektor.es6.js#L57</a>


  Just pass <code>angle</code> to a easing function and that's it. I would
  gladly accept a pull request if you have time to make one.


  Cheers!
