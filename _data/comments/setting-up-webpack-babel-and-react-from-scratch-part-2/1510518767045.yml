  Yo!


  I was having trouble with postcss and it was causing compilation errors (11/12/2017): after some stackoverflowing I was able to find a fix that worked for me:


  requiring webpack at the top of my `webpack.config.js`


  <pre>const webpack = require('webpack');</pre>


  and then inside of the `plugins: []` block, I put a new `webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin`:


  Ex:


  <pre>plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: path.join(paths.SRC, 'index.html'),
    }),
    new ExtractTextPlugin('style.bundle.css'),
    new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
        options: {
          context: __dirname,
        postcss: [
            autoprefixer, precss
        ]
      }
    })
  ],</pre>
