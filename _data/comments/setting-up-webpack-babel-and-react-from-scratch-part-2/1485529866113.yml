  Really cool posts, however as you said in 3-rd post that js world is moving
  too fast, your posts really helped me out! Because I did not worked before
  with react stack and it was hard to jump right to webpack2, for instance,
  which is now released as there are not too much examples yet, and a lot of
  boilerplates looked like total overkill for learning project, so thank you a
  lot!
