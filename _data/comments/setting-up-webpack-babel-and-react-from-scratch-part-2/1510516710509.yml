  Hello! These are wonderful tutorials; really digging them and learning a lot
  about the 'magic' behind boilerplates.


  As of 11/12/2017 using


  <pre>{
    test: /\.scss$/,
    loader: 'style!css!sass'
  }</pre>


  will result in the application failing to compile (at least it did for me
  anyway) and in order to fix it I had to add -loader to the 'loaders'


  ex:


  <pre>
  {
    test: /\.scss$/,
    loader: 'style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader'
  }
  </pre>


  Again, thanks for taking the time for these greate tutorials
