  Hi Sean,

  That is correct, <code>position: fixed</code> won't work if any parent element
  has a transform applied. Unfortunately, without a example it is hard what is
  going on in your case. Try applying <code>transform: translate3d(0, 0,
  0)</code> and <code>backface-visibility: hidden</code> hacks, but it is hard
  to tell if that is going to help.


  Cheers!
