  â€œSelf respect by definition is a confidence and pride in knowing that your
  behaviour is both honorable and dignified. When you harass or vilify someone,
  you not only disrespect them, but yourself also.

  Street harassment, sexual violence, sexual harassment, gender-based violence
  and racism, are all acts committed by a person who in fact has no self
  respect.
