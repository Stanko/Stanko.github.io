  Hey there,


  Super amazing component ! I love that it is highly customisable and used it
  well in our desktop version of our platform. 


  Wanted to ask if it is intended to work smoothly on mobile devices ? I gave it
  a test on iOs and Android but found it quite laggy. Am I missing something ? 


  Thanks a lot for your contribution towards front end development.
