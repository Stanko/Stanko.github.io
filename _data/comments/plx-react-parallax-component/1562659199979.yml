  Hey pahosler,



  I'm really glad to hear that. Initially I wrote a simpler parallax
  implementation for a project. Then it looked promising, so I extracted,
  polished and published it as a library. It is awesome to see other people are
  using it. If you can share what you built using Plx, I would love to see it!



  Cheers!
