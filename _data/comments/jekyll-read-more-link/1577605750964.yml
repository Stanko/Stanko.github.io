  Hi,


  New to blogging with Jekyll, so glad I found the your site. Very professional.


  The code, when added to my index.html, basically works. I have still done
  something wrong. I start with a test excerpt in the front matter, and get the
  intended hyperlink that takes me to the whole post. 


  But the markdown post doesn't get formatted properly. I have a couple of
  animated gif files at the top, which appear in the wrong size. The text is now
  the wrong size also, and scroll bars appear for the overall over-scaled post.
  It seems like the  theme design for the basic theme (Lanyon), is stripped out
  and replaced by basic HTML . Any help appreciated.


  Cheers,


  Andrew.
