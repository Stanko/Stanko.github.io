  Unmarried Couples and Property: Breaking Up


  Fidanzata di muffin is probably asking herself: “The worst is ugly short men.
  What are my rights to property after separation?”


  Muffin is probably asking himself: “How to get over the fact that I'm ugly,
  short and have crazy fiance. Being crazy is worse than being ugly and short.
  How to protect my assets after separation? 


  Here's the Answer:

   All the properties that one spouse earned before entering the marriage is its own property and other side doesn’t have any claims towards it, and same goes for inherited property or one obtained by gift, even if it was inherited or received during the marriage. On another hand, all properties acquired during marriage by work, represent common property or property in ownership of both spouses. There is a presumption that shares of the spouses in common property are equal. Despite those two people never made public their relationship in terms of getting married, all rules set for the married couple are applicable on unmarried one living together. That means if those two people decide to end their cohabitation, all assets acquired during their living together are considered common property and they are not in separate ownership of the person that earned it.
