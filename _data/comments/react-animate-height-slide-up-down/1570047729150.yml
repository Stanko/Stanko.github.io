  Hey Ayden,

  I hacked <a
  href="https://codesandbox.io/s/react-animate-height-animate-height-when-content-changes-76gli">an
  example</a> of how you can do it using <code>AnimateHeight</code>. It is a
  little bit tricky, but it works. (Make sure you reset fixed height on window resize.)


  EDIT: Check <a href="/animate-between-two-react-components/">this proof of concept</a> 
  I did some time ago. It animates height and opacity between two React components.


  Cheers!
