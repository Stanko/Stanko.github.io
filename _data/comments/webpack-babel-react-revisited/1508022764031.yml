  Hey Mathew,

  It seems you are running it on Windows, that is a Unix command that fails.
  Unfortunately, I don't have access to a Windows machine. Without one, it is
  hard for me to help you, but you can try this.


  Add your project's folder to Windows PATH by running:

  <pre>set -x PATH ./node_modules/.bin $PATH</pre>


  Then instead of whole <code>/node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
  [arguments]</code> thing, you can just run <code>webpack [arguments]</code>. 


  Note that if you close your cmd, you need to add it to the path again. But
  don't worry, you'll probably need this only once (tutorial switches to using
  <code>npm run</code> commands in the next step).


  If any of you Windows folks is familiar with this, please share more elegant
  solution, so I can update the post.


  Thanks guys!
