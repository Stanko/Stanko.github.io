  Great tutorial, can't wait for examples of this with Redux.  I would also like
  to know how to make this SEO friendly.  If you look at the HTML since the
  content is rendered on the client side the SEO robots can't see the text and
  they index the pages incorrectly.  What solution do you have for this?
