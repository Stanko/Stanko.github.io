  Again, thank you guys!


  @Christian well Gulp is solving a little bit different problem, and it is just
  additional layer on webpack setup. I think it is worth it to invest time to
  learn webpack and switch to it.


  @David good catch, thank you!


  @Koyot depending on the ES2016 features you are after, some are supported in
  the modern browsers, some are not. But still you need to transpile everything
  for older browsers.


  @Anurag I have no experience with MERN, which advantages it has over webpack?
