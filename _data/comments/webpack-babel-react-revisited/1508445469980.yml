  BTW I had tough time trying to submit a comment. When I pressed "Send" button
  it just silently failed without showing me any error message. I did some
  debugging and figured out that when I choose to autocomplete "name" and
  "email" fields of this form my Google Chrome also autocompletes "last_name"
  field which is hidden. And according to validation rules:

  if (lastName !== '') fatalError = true;


  So I had manually erase value from "last_name" field to submit form.


  I don't know if you consider it as an issue or it doesn't even worth of your
  attention, but any way decided to tell you about it :)


  Have a good day!
