  Hey Joseph,


  Making a single application SEO friendly is not an easy task. 


  The best solution is server side rendering (which I also plan to cover later
  on). It means having the same React application execute on a server (in node
  environment) when web request comes to it. Then it returns rendered HTML to a
  client (and search engine crawlers).


  Once loaded on the client side, same React app loads in the browser and takes
  over. So the first render happens on the server and then it continues to work
  as a regular single page app.


  Other, simpler, but uglier solution is to make a simple crawler which will go
  through your app and cache all of the responses. Then it would recognize
  search engine robots and serve them these static pages rather then your app.


  My advice would be to go with server side rendering, it is harder, but it is
  cleaner solution. And you don't have to worry about invalidating the static
  pages cache.


  Thanks!
