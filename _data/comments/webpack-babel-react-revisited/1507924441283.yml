  Thanks guys!


  @Josh thanks for sharing. But intended point of this post is learning, and
  explaining how these tools work. With boilerplates there is a lot of “magic”
  and things hidden under the hood (as an author of <a href="https://github.com/workco/marvin">one</> I can say that with
  confidence).


  As for the comment policy, I just filter out spam.


  Cheers!
