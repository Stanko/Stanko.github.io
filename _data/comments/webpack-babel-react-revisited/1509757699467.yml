  Thanks a lot Stanko! I can't wait to read the following posts you plan to
  write: hot-reload and server-side rendering configuration in particular. I've
  used MERN so far, but it's getting somehow outdated now, without
  maintenance... I'll probably migrate to Marvin soon or at least get some
  inpiration, but I fear the task of doing so!
