I'm a programmer, but I like to think of myself as a maker. I tremendously enjoy software development, experimenting with small projects and playing with random technologies. That is where
this blog comes from.

I'm mostly maker of a digital stuff, but I love bringing digital into physical world. That includes pen plotting my generative art, tinkering with hobby electronics and crafts.

This is my longest living website/blog. It has been up since 2016 and I'm pretty proud how it evolved. I also fool around on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/stanko/) and maintain a few [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~stanko) packages. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Stanko) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stankotadic).


## Work

I'm a Group Technology Director at [Work & Co](https://work.co). Work & Co is a design and technology company, and we help our clients build digital products. I have personally lead the development track on multiple large scale projects. Mailchimp, TED, IKEA and IBM are just a few names on my personal client list.

Prior to Work & Co, I was a CTO at Null Object, small technology agency which I co-founded. We got acquihired and became Work & Co's Belgrade office in 2016.


## Other

My other interests are music,
{{ sidenote(text="crafts", note="Among other things I made my own electric guitar.") }}
and gaming. Old DOS games are what [got me into the tech](/blog/my-programming-story/) in the first place. I love indie games and I'm so happy that we many so people making them today. I'm also a terrible guitar player.

Nick Muffin Man comes from the [Frank Zappa's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMwY49vTBk0) of the same name.
