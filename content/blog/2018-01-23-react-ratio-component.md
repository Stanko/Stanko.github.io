Short one today.

I'm continuing to release [small libraries](/blog/has-tabbed-aka-should-i-release-small-libraries/).
So let me present [react-ratio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ratio), another small React component.
You probably guessed what it does - creates element with the given aspect ratio.

Check [the demo](https://muffinman.io/react-ratio/) or grab [the source code](https://github.com/Stanko/react-ratio)
