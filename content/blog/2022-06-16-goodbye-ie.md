End of an era.

I started my career when
{{ sidenote(text="IE6", note="First time I wrote about [IE6](/blog/ie6-hacks-ten-years-after/) was back in 2009.") }}
was a thing.
And yesterday, [Microsoft announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/internet-explorer-11-desktop-app-retirement-faq/ba-p/2366549) they are retiring IE11. With that, no version of Internet Explorer is longer supported.

Over the years it seemed that we are doomed to support IE forever. We even planned celebrating when we finally don't have to. But today, it feels funny, nobody is celebrating. Modern browsers came in, slowly but surely overthrown it, leaving us with a pretty evergreen landscape today.

So, IE, you weren't really a good browser, but it has been so long, so I bid you farewell!
