Just something to cheer you up for the holidays :)
I got this idea while I was sick in bed, and had nothing smarter to do.
Pure CSS, no JavaScript at all. Hope you like it, I may add some more details.

{{ codepen(
  id="BQgZda",
  title="Counting sheep",
  height=400
) }}


Check the code on [codepen](http://codepen.io/stanko/pen/BQgZda/).

Happy new year!
