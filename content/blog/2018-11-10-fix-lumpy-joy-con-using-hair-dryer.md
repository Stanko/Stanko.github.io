I love my

I have a huge draft about Switch, and how it have put the fun back in gaming for me. It takes me forever to publish it.

Unfortunately, tonight I noticed that one of my Joy-Cons has weird lumps on it.

(This is the image from the internet, not mine.)

On multiple forum threads, people suggested using hair dryer to fix it. But nobody did explain how. I tried it, and in couple of minutes I managed to get it, and here is how I did it.

There are tiny inserts in the cap, and they need to go in to the tiny holes on the joystick. I had three of them fall out. To fix it, just heat it with the hair dryer (I did it for about ten seconds), carefully adjust one insert and rub it a little bit until it falls in. Repeat for each insert.

It was much easier than I thought it would be (before heating it felt impossible). Hopefully they won't fall again, but I will probably get thumb grips to be sure.
