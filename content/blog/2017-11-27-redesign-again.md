Muffin Man is back! This time with new visual identity.

This was long overdue, but new design took me
{{ sidenote(text="more than I wanted to.", note="Mostly because of the [trillion](/blog/trillion-ideas/) things I'm working on.") }}
Now I can get back to writing.

Alogn with the new design, some other things got updated too,
hopefully making content easier to browse. To name a few:

* Archive is now one page with category accordion (every category used to have a dedicated page)
* You can now find related posts under each post (instead of the latest ones)
* Search results are now navigable using arrows


I ditched custom Jekyll plugins to be able to use GitHub to automatically build the whole thing.
Some of them got rewritten to Liquid.

Hope you like it!
