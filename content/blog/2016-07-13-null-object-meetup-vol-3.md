Another tech meetup is behind us, even more people came this time.
As promised, we will keep them coming more often.

Miloš spoke first about learning in tech, and keeping up with it.
My talk was about SPAs, and how hard they are.

<!-- more -->

We hope that meetups like this will help to build and strengthen the community in Belgrade, and Serbia in general.
At this point that is not something we can brag about.
We are planning charity hackatons as well and I'll keep you posted about them.
