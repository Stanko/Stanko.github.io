Yesterday, one of my colleagues shared [UI Movement](https://uimovement.com/) website. It resulted in me playing with random animations trying to replicate mockups I liked.

Here are the results:

{{ codepen(
  id="PdwGEy",
  title="Fancy input, CSS animation",
  height=300
) }}

{{ codepen(
  id="KxwLpd",
  title="Kick input, SVG animation",
  height=300
) }}
