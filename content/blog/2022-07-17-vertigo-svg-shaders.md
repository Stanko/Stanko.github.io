[Vertigo](https://muffinman.io/vertigo/) was created in 2018. Soon after, I wrote a blog post about it, but my laptop died before I was able to publish it. I never [made myself](/blog/back-to-the-basics/#building-a-brand) to write another one. But it is a project close to my heart, so I'm finally taking some time to write about it, four years later.
