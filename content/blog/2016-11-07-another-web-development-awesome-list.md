### Update November 2017

Unfortunately, I'm not maintaining this repo anymore.
Still, there are couple of really useful links on it.

---

People are making *awesome* lists on the Git these days.

I'm spamming our company's slack dev channel, and someone suggested to put all of those links in one place.
So I created one awesome list as well.

Feel free to contribute!
