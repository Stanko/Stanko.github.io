In 2020 I started playing with generative art and I immediately fell in love with it. Soon after, I got a pen plotter. The plotter allows me to bring these digital drawings to the physical world.  {{ sidenote(text="All of the drawings below", note="If not stated otherwise") }}
are real, physical, pen plotted drawings on paper.

I'm very proud of my drawings, so I really hope you'll like them. For more experiments and work in progress check out my Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/muffinman_io">profile</a>.
