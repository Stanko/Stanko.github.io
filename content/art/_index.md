<div class="notice">This page is still a work in progress. I will be adding more drawings in the following days, but I wanted to launch it as soon as the page became presentable. Meanwhile, for more content you can check my <a href="https://instagram.com/muffinman_io">Instagram account</a>.</div>

In 2020 I started playing with generative art and I immediately fell in love with it. Soon after, I got a pen plotter. Plotter allows me to bring these digital drawings to the physical world.

I'm very proud of my drawings, so I really hope you'll like them.
