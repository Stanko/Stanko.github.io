I started drawing these little houses a while ago, but never finished the project. Meanwhile, I decided to participate in [Plot Party postcard exchange](https://penplotterartwork.com/plotparty/). So, I came back to my houses and used them to generate little towns as postcards.

At the moment, they are on their way to five different countries, and I'll probably plot a few more.
