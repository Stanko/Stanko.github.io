You can play with algorithm [here](https://neon.muffinman.io/) and download images. It took me ages to find appropriate pens to plot this one. Also check [the blog post](http://motorhead.local:1234/blog/neon-generative-art-piece-made-using-2d-vector-field/) about how it is made.

On the images below you can see two different drawings.
