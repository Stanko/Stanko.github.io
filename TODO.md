## Must have

* use images from art, when displaying pieces in posts
* real breadcrumbs (instead of "back to art"), add on blog as well

## Maybe / nice to have

* article tag for posts - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article
* more categories?
* mention #debug in post
* spoiler and sidenote reveal animation
* mini game
* dark mode
* parallax
* clean up gallery/art-single SCSS (tall/wide)
* custom icons for photoswipe
